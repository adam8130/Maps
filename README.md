basically it is a practicing of building a project using Api and UI library, and I'll keep update for more new features  
like distance, personal-map-mode  
<br/>
Exist Features:  
  '01' users are able to switch somefeatures via top middle pannel, like dark-mode or clear-mode  
  '02' using react-slick for carousel and autoplay the photos  
  '03' using Material-breakpoint to implement RWD for mobile-phone  
<br/>
Hope u like
